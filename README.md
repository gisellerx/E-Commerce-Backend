## Description

Given a functional Express.js API
When I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
Then I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
When I enter schema and seed commands
Then a development database is created and is seeded with test data
When I enter the command to invoke the application
Then my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
Then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
Then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
